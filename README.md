DEPRECATED - Reverse Relations plugin for Craft CMS
=================
Plugin that allows you to show and save reverse relations in both the CP and the Site.

Features:
- Able to output the relation in the CP and in the site (no other plugin has this feature)
- Only supports entries at the moment

Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "reverserelations"

Deprecated
=================
With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this tool has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.
